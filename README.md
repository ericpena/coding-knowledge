# Coding Examples Repository

Welcome to my coding examples repository! This repository is a collection of various coding exercises and examples that I come across as I study. The goal is to document and share these examples, making it easier for others (and myself) to refer back to them in the future.

## Overview

This repository contains coding examples primarily in Python and SQL. Each example is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and reuse. The examples cover a range of topics and difficulty levels, suitable for both beginners and more advanced users.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the programming language and topic. Here is the general structure:

.
├── Python
│ ├── Basics
│ ├── Data Structures
│ ├── Algorithms
│ ├── Libraries
│ │ ├── Pandas

## Python Examples

In the `Python` directory, you will find examples ranging from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics like algorithms and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Examples:

- **Basics**: Simple programs to understand Python syntax and basic concepts.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation and usage of data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Common algorithms including sorting, searching, and others.
- **Libraries**: Examples using popular Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

## SQL Examples

The `SQL` directory contains examples of SQL queries and concepts. These examples range from basic query syntax to more complex operations like joins, subqueries, and query optimization techniques.

### Examples:

- **Basics**: Basic SQL commands for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
- **Queries**: Examples of selecting and filtering data from databases.
- **Joins**: Different types of joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Subqueries**: Using subqueries to perform more complex data operations.
- **Optimization**: Techniques to optimize SQL queries for better performance.
